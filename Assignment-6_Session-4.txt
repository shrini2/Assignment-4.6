Problem Statement:

1. A recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a
source in at least one of their term paper. Let X equal the number of students in a random sample of
size n=31 who have used Wikipedia as a source.

Perform the below functions:

a. Find the probability that X is equal to 17.
Answer-
dbinom(17, 31, 0.447)
# The probability of X equal to 17 is 0.0753

b. Find the probability that X is at most 13.
Answer-
pbinom(13, 31, 0.447)
# The probability of X at most 13 is 0.4513

c. Find the probability that X is bigger than 11.
Answer-
1-pbinom(11, 31, 0.447)
# The probability of X bigger than 11 is 0.8020

d. Find the probability that X is at least 15.
Answer-
1- pbinom(14, 31, 0.447)
# The probability of X at least 15 is 0.4060

e. Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19, inclusive.
Answer-
sum(dbinom(16:19, 31, 0.447))
# The probability of X between 16 and 19, inclusive is 0.2545
